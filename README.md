This repository contains barebones C# MVC snippets to post contacts and companies to HubSpot.com using their REST API.

The most important element is the Wiki (https://github.com/KenCox/HubSpotMVC/wiki) that gets you over the non-programming configuration hurdles.

Contact me if you want to do an integration between RainWorx AuctionWorx and HubSpot. That was the genesis of the tutorial.
